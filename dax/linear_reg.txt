/* This file contains all the 3 DAX measures for new table creation using LINESTX function.

To create new table, follow these steps:
    1. Go to Home > Modeling > New Table
    2. Copy and paste the code below into the formula bar
    3. Click OK 
 
This DAX measure is used to create a new table that contains 
the regression coefficients for the linear regression model.
This DAX is prepared by Syarmine*/

1. Linear Regression Age to Sales
reg_age = LINESTX(PredictData,
        [Sales], [Age])


2. Linear Regression Income to Sales
reg_income = LINESTX(PredictData,
        [Sales], [Income])

3. Linear Regression Gender to Sales
reg_gender = LINESTX(PredictData,
        [Sales], [GenderDummy])

4. Linear Regression Income, Age and Gender to Sales
reg_income_age_gender = LINESTX(PredictData,
        [Sales],
        [Income], [Age], [GenderDummy]
    )
